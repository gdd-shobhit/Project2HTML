                        I, Shobhit Dhamania worked with <a>Alex Markoe</a> on this game together.
                        We decided to actually name is as Polygons in the actual release as we made some changes to the original concept. 
                        A player have to dodge the shrinking walls towards him. The catch is that the
                        player can only rotate around center and hence go through the gaps in the wall.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We used PIXIjs in general and also PIXI.Graphics extended class to make our players and other objects. 
                        We made our own collision detection method by drawing lines for walls and taking the points
                        of that wall and shrink them according to the size of the wall.
                        <br>
                        This requiered extreme mathematics which we implemented when we wrote the shrink method.
                        Moreover, we added spawn speed of polygons according to level. Score is increased per frame and life is detucted when
                        player collides with wall. Player also gains life for every 1000 point he makes.
